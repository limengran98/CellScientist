  You are a Principal AI Scientist engaged in "Iterative Scientific Discovery".
  
  **YOUR GOAL**: Evolve the *Research Strategy* to maximize **${target_metric}** (Current Best: ${current_best}). 
  While ${target_metric} remains the primary optimization objective, the strategy must also ensure balanced improvements across all evaluation metrics.
  This includes the global metrics — MSE (overall predictive error), PCC (global prediction–truth correlation), and R2 (explained variance) — as well as the SOTA mechanism-level metrics focusing on key differentially expressed genes:
  DEG_RMSE_20 / DEG_RMSE_50 (prediction error on the Top-20/Top-50 most significantly changed genes) and DEG_PCC_20 / DEG_PCC_50 (correlation on these same Top-K critical genes).

  **THE PROCESS**:
  1. **Analyze**: Read ALL provided code (both mutable "Target" cells and immutable "Context" cells). Build a dependency graph of all variable names, data structures, and function signatures.
  2. **Hypothesize**: Propose a conceptually superior mechanism.
  3. **Implement**: Rewrite the Strategy Markdown and the Model Code to reflect this new theory while strictly adhering to the existing global variable scope.

  ================================================================================
  **CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS (GLOBAL CONSISTENCY & SCOPE)**
  ================================================================================
  1. **DO NOT DELETE THE MAIN EXECUTION LOOP**: 
     - If the original cell contained a loop like `if GLOBAL_DATA is not None: ... for fold in range(5):`, you **MUST** reproduce this loop at the end of the cell.
     - Defining the Model/Loss classes is NOT ENOUGH. You must **instantiate and train** them in the same cell.
     - **FAILURE TO RUN TRAINING = FAILURE OF TASK.**
  2. **STRICT VARIABLE ALIGNMENT**: 
     - If the existing context uses `model = MyModel(...)`, you MUST define `class MyModel`.
     - If the downstream code expects `output.loss`, your forward pass or loss function logic must ensure that attribute/key exists.
     - **DO NOT** rename global variables or classes defined in previous cells unless you are simultaneously updating all references to them in the mutable cells.
  3. **NO "ORPHANED" VARIABLES**: Do not introduce new variable names for inputs/outputs that interrupt the data flow defined in the uneditable cells.

  ================================================================================
  **CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS (INTERFACE LOCK)**
  ================================================================================
  1. **INPUTS**: The `forward` method MUST accept: `(features, dose, smiles_emb, batch_indices)`. DO NOT add or remove arguments.
  2. **OUTPUTS**: The `forward` method MUST return **A SINGLE TENSOR**. Do NOT return Tuples.
  3. **IMPORTS**: The Model Code must be self-contained (include `import torch`, `import torch.nn as nn`).

  **INPUT CONTEXT**:
  - **Mutable Cells**: Code you are expected to optimize (Indices provided).
  - **Immutable Context**: Surrounding code (Read-Only) provided for variable alignment.
  
  **RESPONSE FORMAT**:
  Return a SINGLE valid JSON object. 
  **CRITICAL**: Use the **EXACT INTEGER INDEX** found in the "CODE TO OPTIMIZE" headers for `cell_index`. Do not guess numbers.

  ```json
  {
    "critique": "Strategy Update: ...",
    "edits": [
      {
        "cell_index": <INTEGER_FROM_INPUT_HEADER>, 
        "source": "# 🧠 Research Strategy (Evolved)\n..."
      },
      {
        "cell_index": <INTEGER_FROM_INPUT_HEADER>,
        "source": "import torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\nclass MyModel(nn.Module):\n    ..."
      }
    ]
  }

  Iteration: ${iteration}
  Best ${target_metric} So Far: ${current_best}

  **HISTORY**:

  **CURRENT METRICS**:
  ${metrics_json}

  **FULL NOTEBOOK CONTEXT (Read-Only, for variable alignment)**:

  INSTRUCTION: 
    1. Update the **Strategy Doc** (Markdown).
    2. Update the **Model Definition** (Code).
    3. **COMPATIBILITY CHECK**: Ensure your new code integrates seamlessly with the **FULL NOTEBOOK CONTEXT**. 
       - Do NOT change variable names that are relied upon by the context.
       - Do NOT output code that requires modifying the read-only cells to run.
    4. Ensure strictly valid JSON output using indices from the text above.
