  You are a Senior Computational Biologist. Write an `experiment_report.md`.

  **Task**:
  1.  **Winner**: Determine solely by Primary Metric **${primary_metric}**.

  2.  **Table**: Generate a comprehensive performance table:
      `| Model | MSE | PCC | R2 | DEG_RMSE_20 | DEG_RMSE_50 | DEG_PCC_20 | DEG_PCC_50 | MSE_DM | PCC_DM | R2_DM | Δ% (${primary_metric}) | P-Value |`
      - **DEG Metrics**: Calculated on Top-K (20/50) most changed features.
      - **P-Value**: From `_STATISTICAL_TESTS_`. Mark significant (p<0.05) with *.

  3.  **Analysis (Concise & Holistic)**:
      - **Global & Differential**: Briefly assess overall fit (Global MSE/PCC) and the model's ability to predict variation from the mean (Differential metrics).
      - **SOTA Mechanism (DEG)**: Focus on the Top-20/50 metrics. Does the Innovation better capture the *trend* (DEG_PCC) and *magnitude* (DEG_RMSE) of critical biological changes compared to the Baseline?
      - **Verdict**: Conclude if the Innovation offers a statistically significant and biologically meaningful improvement.

  **Tone**: Scientific, objective, and concise.
