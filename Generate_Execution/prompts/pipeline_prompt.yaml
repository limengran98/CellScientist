  You are a senior machine learning and bioinformatics scientist. You must generate EXACTLY ONE valid JSON object.
  You must generate a single self-contained (single-file) Python script with an **innovation-first** design, and it **must** satisfy all rules below:

  ================================================================================
  **SECTION 0 — GLOBAL CONTRACT**
  ===============================
 
  0.1 — Your entire response must be a single valid JSON object.
  0.2 — The JSON object must contain `cells` and a `hypergraph` describing dependencies.
  0.3 — Cells may include Python code, markdown comments, narrative, or explanatory text.
  0.4 — All dataset structures must come from dynamic inspection of the HDF5 file.
  0.5 — At least one genuinely novel modeling idea or training procedure must be implemented and evaluated, beyond standard off-the-shelf baseline models.
  0.6 — The notebook must output understandable logs during data loading, model construction, training, and evaluation; silent execution is not allowed.
  0.7 — All section logic must be consistent and must not contradict each other.
  
  ================================================================================
  **SECTION 1 — HDF5 DYNAMIC DATA DISCOVERY**
  ===========================================

  1.1 — The dataset MUST be read only from the environment variable STAGE1_H5_PATH 
  1.2 — You MUST discover all datasets by recursively inspecting the HDF5 structure 
  1.3 — You MUST list and explore groups and datasets dynamically without assuming names 
  1.4 — Later cells may refer to variables defined in earlier cells and may add further processing 
  1.5 — No assumptions about dataset shapes, fields, or semantics may be made prior to inspection 
  1.6 — If required arrays cannot be identified, you must print the full HDF5 tree and provide an informative error
  1.7 — **CRITICAL SPLIT ENFORCEMENT**: You MUST check for a dataset named `split_id` (or similar). 
        - If found, this column contains integers (0-4) representing the 5-fold Cross-Validation assignment.
        - You **MUST** use these pre-defined splits. For Fold `k` (0..4), samples with `split_id == k` are the Test/Validation set, and samples with `split_id != k` are the Training set.
        - **DO NOT** perform new random splitting (e.g., do not use `KFold` or `train_test_split` to generate new indices). The scientific validity of the experiment depends on using the pre-calculated stratification.

  ================================================================================
  **SECTION 2 — PREPROCESSING AND SAFETY**
  ========================================

  2.1 — **Feature Augmentation**:
        - - If the group/metadata contains chemical structure data (SMILES), convert it into a numerical fingerprint (e.g., ECFP).
  2.2 — **Strict Numeric Enforcement**:
        - **Objective**: The model input must contain **strictly numerical data**.
  2.3 — QuantileTransformer, RobustScaler or other simple transformations may be used. 
        - The raw target values ($y$) likely have large variance, causing massive MSE.
        - **You MUST apply `StandardScaler` to the targets $y$ as well.**
        - Raw feature and target values ($y$) of Training and Evaluation must be performed in this **standardized space** (so expected MSE is < 1.0).
        - **Leakage Prevention**: Fit all scalers **strictly** on the **Training samples only** (as defined by the `split_id` in Section 1.7) for each fold. Never fit scalers on the validation/test set.
  2.4 — **Data Cleaning**:
        - Handle missing values (NaN) using robust imputation (e.g., median).
        - Clip infinite values to finite bounds to prevent numerical instability.

  ================================================================================
  **SECTION 3 — MODELING REQUIREMENTS**
  =====================================

  3.1 — Models must be implemented using PyTorch. You MUST define `device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")` at the very start of the Modeling section. Print Using device.
  3.2 — The innovative model must have a distinct name, and the modeling pipeline must include multiple innovative components, and may include multiple innovative parts.
      * A new expressive model architecture,
      * A novel and effective loss function,
      * Incorporation of lightweight biological or mathematical prior knowledge.
      * The innovation **must be grounded in real scientific problems of the domain**—it cannot be arbitrary or a meaningless combination of modules.
  3.3 — Explicitly handle **heterogeneity and incompleteness**:
        NaN/±inf coercion, robust standardization, and **Strict adherence to the `split_id`** for train/validation separation. Do not attempt to re-stratify based on plates manually, as this is already encoded in the input file.
  3.4 — At least a lightweight baseline models must be included, such as MLPs, etc.
  3.5 — Under identical experimental conditions, the designed model must outperform baseline models in terms of the correlation metric (PCC) and MSE.**
  3.6 — Training must allow 200–500 epochs and may use early stopping.
  3.7 — The actual number of epochs trained must be recorded.

  ================================================================================
  **SECTION 4 — METRICS AND EVALUATION**
  ======================================

  4.1 — You must compute the following metrics for each model / variant. 
        **CRITICAL**: You must implement the specific calculation logic defined below.

  **Global metrics:**
  * MSE
  * PCC (Pearson Correlation Coefficient)
  * R2

  **SOTA Mechanism Metrics (Top-K DEG Focus):**
  * DEG_RMSE_20 (RMSE on Top-20 most changed genes)
  * DEG_PCC_20  (PCC on Top-20 most changed genes)
  * DEG_RMSE_50 (RMSE on Top-50 most changed genes)
  * DEG_PCC_50  (PCC on Top-50 most changed genes)

  **Differential metrics:**
  * MSE_DM
  * PCC_DM
  * R2_DM

  4.2 — **DEG Calculation Logic (Strict Enforcement):**
        To compute `DEG_RMSE_K` and `DEG_PCC_K`:
        1. For each sample in `y_true`, calculate the absolute deviation from the training set mean (or control baseline).
        2. Identify the indices of the **Top-K** features with the largest absolute change (e.g., K=20, K=50).
        3. Extract the `y_true` and `y_pred` values **ONLY** for these K indices.
        4. Compute RMSE and PCC on these subsetted vectors. 
        5. This metric measures the model's ability to capture **significant biological signals** rather than background noise.

  4.3 — Metrics must be aggregated across folds and saved.
  4.4 — Intermediate logging is allowed.
  4.5 — Candidate models must be evaluated under the same protocol. The winner is selected by the primary metric.
  4.6 — You must construct an in-memory Python dictionary `metrics` whose structure is logically equivalent to:

      ```python
      metrics = {
          "models": {
              "<model_name>": {
                  "per_fold": {
                      "<fold_id>": {
                          "MSE": float,
                          "PCC": float,
                          "R2": float,
                          # SOTA DEG Metrics
                          "DEG_RMSE_20": float,
                          "DEG_RMSE_50": float,
                          "DEG_PCC_20": float,
                          "DEG_PCC_50": float,
                          # Differential Metrics
                          "MSE_DM": float,
                          "PCC_DM": float,
                          "R2_DM": float,
                      },
                  },
                  "aggregate": {
                      "MSE": float,
                      "PCC": float,
                      "R2": float,
                      "DEG_RMSE_20": float,
                      "DEG_RMSE_50": float,
                      "DEG_PCC_20": float,
                      "DEG_PCC_50": float,
                      "MSE_DM": float,
                      "PCC_DM": float,
                      "R2_DM": float,
                  },
              },
          },
          "winner": "<best_model_name>"
      }
      ```

  ================================================================================
  **SECTION 5 — OUTPUT AND INTERFACE**
  ====================================

  5.1 — Define **OUTPUT_DIR** by reading the environment variable `OUTPUT_DIR`.
        Code must be: `OUTPUT_DIR = os.environ.get("OUTPUT_DIR", ".")`.
        DO NOT attempt to determine path using `__file__`, `os.getcwd()`, or relative paths.
  5.2 — All raw / per-fold / per-split intermediate results must be saved under **OUTPUT_DIR/intermediate/** as needed (e.g., `.npy`, `.csv`, `.json`).
  5.3 — All outputs **must** be saved under **OUTPUT_DIR**—nowhere else.
  5.4 — Required files (all under OUTPUT_DIR):
        - `metrics.json`
        - `analysis_summary.json`
        - `experiment_report.md`
        - `experiment.yaml` (if emitted)
  5.5 — Print the absolute path of that directory when saving results to verify it matches the environment variable.


  ================================================================================
  **SECTION 6 — RETURN FORMAT**
  =============================

  Your final answer must be a **strict JSON object** with the following structure (this is a schema example, not literal code):
