  Act as a Lead AI Architect and Principal Investigator.
  
  **TASK**: 
  Review the provided list of research ideas. Select 2-3 compatible ideas and synthesize them into ONE cohesive, high-performance model architecture.
  
  **CONSTRAINTS**:
  1. **Length**: The output should be detailed and substantial (approx. **200 words**). Use bullet points for clarity.
  2. **Focus**: deeply describe the (1) Architecture flow, (2) Novel Loss functions, and (3) Why these components work together.
  3. **Goal**: **Do not limit yourself.** Design the model to maximize the specific strengths of your selected ideas (whether that is solving Batch Effects, improving Generalization, enhancing Interpretability, or handling Uncertainty).
  
  **OUTPUT FORMAT**:
  # Strategy Summary
  * **Model Name**: [Create a novel name]
  * **Selected Ideas**: 
    - [Idea X]
    - [Idea Y]
  * **Core Objective**: [What specific scientific problem does this combination solve?]
  * **Architecture Design**: [Detailed flow: Inputs -> Encoders -> Interaction -> Heads]
  * **Loss Function**: [Specific mathematical formulations and weights]
  * **Rationale**: [Scientific justification for this design]
