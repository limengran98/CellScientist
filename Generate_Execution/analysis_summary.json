  "why_it_wins": "AFAN_LowDropout wins because: (1) It achieves the highest f1_macro score of 0.3758, (2) The multi-head attention mechanism effectively learns which morphological features are most discriminative for compound classification, (3) Gated residual connections allow the model to adaptively weight attended features, (4) Batch normalization and dropout provide robustness to heterogeneity in the Cell Painting data, (5) The architecture balances model capacity with regularization to avoid overfitting on high-dimensional features.",
