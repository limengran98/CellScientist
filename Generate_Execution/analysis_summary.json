  "hypotheses": [
    "The primary hypothesis is that a standard MSE loss is suboptimal for high-dimensional biological profile prediction.",
    "A custom 'ProfileLoss' that combines MSE with a cosine similarity term will encourage the model to learn the overall 'shape' of the cellular profile vector, leading to better generalization on unseen compounds."
  ],
  "ablations": [
    "The key ablation is the comparison between 'ProfileNet_alpha0.5' (using the custom loss) and 'ProfileNet_MSE_Only' (using a standard MSE loss, alpha=1.0).",
    "This directly isolates the impact of the cosine similarity component of the loss function."
  ],
  "why_it_wins": "The winning model, 'N/A', achieved the best performance on the primary metric 'PCC' with a score of -inf.",
  "next_steps": [
    "Perform a hyperparameter sweep on the loss mixing parameter 'alpha' to find the optimal balance between MSE and cosine similarity.",
    "Explore more complex neural network architectures, such as those incorporating attention mechanisms over the input chemical features.",
    "Investigate the model's performance on specific compound classes or mechanisms of action to identify areas of strength and weakness."
