      "title": "Multi-Modal Contrastive Learning (Chem-Bio CLIP)",
      "description": "Implement a dual-encoder architecture where one branch encodes molecular structures (SMILES) via a Graph Neural Network (GNN) or Transformer, and the other encodes phenotypic profiles (Morphology) via an MLP. Use a contrastive loss function (e.g., InfoNCE) to maximize the cosine similarity between matched molecule-phenotype pairs while minimizing it for mismatched pairs.",
      "reasoning": "This approach leverages the paired nature of the dataset (SMILES + Morphology) to learn a joint latent space. It specifically addresses the high redundancy in morphological features by forcing the model to focus only on chemically relevant phenotypic variances.",
      "expected_impact": "Enables zero-shot prediction of phenotypes for novel compounds and facilitates highly accurate retrieval of compounds that produce specific morphological desired states (e.g., 'find a molecule that mimics this healthy cell state')."
    },
    {
      "title": "Conditional Variational Autoencoder (cVAE) for Perturbation Synthesis",
      "description": "Train a cVAE to reconstruct the 'Post' (Treated) morphological vector conditioned on the 'Pre' (DMSO) vector and the compound's SMILES embedding. The model learns the distribution $P(Post | Pre, Compound, Dose)$.",
      "reasoning": "Standard regression models (MSE) often produce blurry average predictions. A generative approach captures the stochastic nature of biological responses and allows us to sample multiple potential outcomes for a single treatment, providing uncertainty estimates.",
      "expected_impact": "Allows for the generation of 'virtual assays'. We can screen libraries of millions of SMILES in silico to predict their morphological impact and filter out compounds predicted to induce toxic phenotypes (outliers in the latent space)."
    },
    {
      "title": "Graph-Informed Morphological Attention Network",
      "description": "Develop a model that uses an Attention Mechanism to map specific sub-graphs of the molecule (functional groups derived from SMILES) to specific clusters of morphological features. The model predicts the 'Post' state, but the architecture explicitly weights the contribution of molecular atoms to feature changes.",
      "reasoning": "This directly addresses the 'black box' nature of deep learning. By linking molecular substructures to specific morphological changes (e.g., 'this nitrogen ring causes nuclear fragmentation'), we ground the predictions in chemical intuition.",
      "expected_impact": "Provides interpretability for Mechanism of Action (MoA). It can identify pharmacophores responsible for specific toxicities or therapeutic effects, aiding in lead optimization."
    },
    {
      "title": "Adversarial De-biasing for Batch Effect Removal",
      "description": "Construct an autoencoder with an adversarial branch. The encoder learns a latent representation of the cell morphology. The adversarial branch tries to predict the 'Plate ID' from this latent representation. The encoder is trained to minimize reconstruction error while *maximizing* the adversary's error.",
      "reasoning": "The context highlights residual plate effects as a major limitation despite robust normalization. This method mathematically forces the latent space to be invariant to technical variation (Plate ID) while retaining biological variation.",
      "expected_impact": "Produces a 'pure' biological embedding space. Clustering this cleaned space should yield significantly tighter clusters for compounds with the same Mechanism of Action, improving downstream classification performance."
    },
    {
      "title": "Continuous Dose-Response Surface Modeling",
      "description": "Instead of treating 'Dose' as a categorical input or a simple scalar, use a Hypernetwork or a specialized architecture that enforces monotonicity constraints to model the morphological transition as a continuous function of dose. $Morphology = f(SMILES, Dose)$.",
      "reasoning": "Biological responses to dose are often sigmoidal or biphasic but continuous. Deep learning models can overfit to specific dose points. Constraining the manifold to be smooth with respect to dose improves generalization to unseen concentrations.",
      "expected_impact": "Enables the prediction of IC50/EC50 values directly from high-dimensional phenotypic data and allows for the interpolation of effects at doses not physically tested in the screen."
    },
    {
      "title": "Transformer-based Sequence-to-Phenotype Translation",
      "description": "Treat the SMILES string as a sequence of tokens and the morphological feature vector as a 'target language'. Fine-tune a pre-trained chemical language model (like ChemBERTa or MegaMolBART) to 'translate' the chemical sentence into a morphological vector.",
      "reasoning": "Large Language Models have learned rich representations of chemical syntax. Transfer learning from millions of chemical structures can boost performance on this smaller, specific dataset (BBBC036), especially for rare scaffolds.",
      "expected_impact": "Likely to yield the highest predictive accuracy for novel chemical scaffolds by leveraging the massive pre-training knowledge base of chemical properties."
    },
    {
      "title": "Self-Supervised Multi-Task MoA Classification",
      "description": "Create a multi-task learning framework where the model predicts the 'Post' morphology vector (Regression) while simultaneously predicting the Mechanism of Action class (Classification) if labels are available, or a self-generated cluster label if not.",
      "reasoning": "Morphological features are often highly correlated. Forcing the model to predict high-level biological concepts (MoA) acts as a regularizer, preventing overfitting to noise in individual feature channels.",
      "expected_impact": "Improves the robustness of the learned features. The internal representations will be aligned with biological mechanisms rather than just raw pixel statistics, making the model more useful for target identification."
