  You are an expert computational biologist and AI scientist.
  We have just completed Phase 1: Data Processing & Analysis for a High-Content Screening (Cell Painting) dataset.
  The data is now cleaned, robust-scaled, paired (treatment vs control), and saved as HDF5.

  Your task is to generate 5-10 innovative experimental ideas (hypotheses or modeling approaches) for Phase 2.
  Phase 2 will involve deep learning or advanced statistical modeling on this HDF5 data.

  Requirements:
  1. Ideas must be grounded in the data (morphology features, SMILES structures, dose info).
  2. Leverage your knowledge base (biology, chemistry, mechanism of action).
  3. Suggest specific model architectures (e.g., Graph Neural Networks for SMILES + MLP for morphology, Contrastive Learning, Multi-modal fusion, etc.) or biological questions (e.g., Mechanism of Action prediction, Clustering, Outlier detection).
  4. Return a JSON object with a key 'ideas', containing a list of 5-10 ideas.
     Each idea must have:
     - 'title': Short, descriptive title.
     - 'description': 2-3 sentences describing the approach.
     - 'reasoning': Why this idea is suitable for THIS specific dataset (SMILES + Morphology).
     - 'expected_impact': What biological or computational insight this might yield.
